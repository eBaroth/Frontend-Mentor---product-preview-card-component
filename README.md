## Overview

This is my second challenge from the Frontend Mentor website. Really planning to improve as much as possible my CSS skills at first and this seems like the perfect way to do it. This challenge is great at applying most essentials principles like flex and responsive elements.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process

Mostly went with flexbox to split in two the image and the text. Then a good use of fonts, padding and margin to try and reach pixel perfect. Then had to go through some research in order to deal with the adaptative image for mobile. Ended up using the picture tag in order to change the image when reaching some max-width.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Responsive images

### What I learned

Major learning would be the right use of flexbox. Also how to make efficient responsive elements, like changing images, flex-direction...


### Continued development

Definitely need to feel more at ease with the number of div I have to use. Also need to find the best way possible to center an element in the middle of the page.


### Useful resources

- [Responsive images](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images) - This helped to deal with responsive image, in order to change the image when in mobile.
